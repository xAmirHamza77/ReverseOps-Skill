# Attack Chain Playbook Quick Reference

> Pick the playbook matching the target type. Each playbook defines the standard path from initial access to objective completion.

## Playbook 1: External Web Application to Domain Controller

```
1. Subdomain enumeration + port scanning
2. Web fingerprinting -> identify components with known vulnerabilities
3. Exploit a vulnerability to obtain a Webshell / RCE
4. Internal information gathering (ipconfig/ifconfig, arp, net user)
5. Set up a tunnel (frp/chisel/ssh)
6. Internal scanning (live hosts, open ports)
7. Credential acquisition (mimikatz/hashdump/config files)
8. Lateral movement (PTH/WMI/PsExec)
9. Domain information gathering (BloodHound)
10. Domain privilege escalation (Kerberoasting/DCSync/constrained delegation)
11. Obtain domain controller access
```

**Key toolchain**: subfinder -> httpx -> nuclei -> sqlmap/sstimap -> frp -> nmap -> mimikatz -> crackmapexec -> bloodhound -> certipy

---

## Playbook 2: Phishing to Internal Network Penetration

```
1. Gather target employee information (LinkedIn/Maimai)
2. Craft phishing emails (spoofed sender / legitimate subject)
3. Build the payload (macro document/LNK/ISO/HTML smuggling)
4. Send phishing emails
5. Wait for a callback (C2 beacon)
6. Local information gathering + privilege escalation
7. Credential extraction
8. Lateral movement
9. Persistence
10. Objective complete
```

**Key toolchain**: theHarvester -> gophish -> msfvenom/cobalt-strike -> mimikatz -> bloodhound

---

## Playbook 3: Physical Proximity Penetration to Internal Network

```
1. Physical reconnaissance (WiFi signals, access control type, USB ports)
2. WiFi attack (Fluxion rogue AP / WPA cracking)
   or BadUSB implant (Rubber Ducky keystroke injection)
   or network implant (Raspberry Pi / LAN Turtle)
3. Obtain an internal network foothold
4. Internal scanning
5. Continue with steps 5-11 of Playbook 1
```

**Key toolchain**: fluxion/aircrack-ng -> rubber-ducky -> frp -> nmap -> crackmapexec

---

## Playbook 4: Cloud Environment Penetration

```
1. Cloud asset discovery (subdomains -> CNAME -> cloud provider)
2. Storage bucket enumeration (S3/OSS/Blob public access)
3. SSRF -> cloud metadata (169.254.169.254)
4. Obtain temporary credentials (AK/SK/Token)
5. Cloud API enumeration (IAM/EC2/Lambda/RDS)
6. Privilege escalation (PassRole/AssumeRole)
7. Lateral movement (cross-account/cross-region)
8. Data acquisition
```

**Key toolchain**: subfinder -> nuclei(ssrf) -> aws-cli -> pacu -> ScoutSuite

---

## Playbook 5: Bug Bounty / SRC Rapid Testing

```
1. Asset collection (subdomains + ports + JS files)
2. Fingerprinting -> rapid validation of known vulnerabilities (nuclei)
3. Parameter discovery (arjun/paramspider)
4. Test category by category:
   - IDOR/BOLA (change IDs/roles)
   - SSRF (internal probing/cloud metadata)
   - SQL injection (sqlmap)
   - XSS (xsstrike)
   - File upload (detection bypass)
   - Logic flaws (payment/captcha/password reset)
5. Write PoC + submit report
```

**Key toolchain**: subfinder -> httpx -> nuclei -> arjun -> sqlmap -> xsstrike -> burpsuite

---

## Playbook 6: AD CS Certificate Attacks

```
1. Discover AD CS services (certipy find)
2. Identify vulnerable templates (ESC1-ESC8)
3. Request malicious certificates
4. Authenticate as the target user with the certificate
5. Obtain NTLM hash or TGT
6. DCSync to dump all credentials
```

**Key toolchain**: certipy -> rubeus -> mimikatz -> secretsdump

## General Decision Matrix

| Current state | Next priority step |
|---------|-------------|
| Only a target domain | Subdomain enumeration -> port scanning -> Web fingerprinting |
| Have a web vulnerability | Get a shell -> internal information gathering |
| Have a low-privilege shell | Privilege escalation -> credential extraction |
| Have one internal machine | Set up a tunnel -> internal scanning -> lateral movement |
| Have domain user credentials | BloodHound -> find attack paths |
| Have a domain admin hash | DCSync -> Golden Ticket |
| Have cloud AK/SK | Enumerate permissions -> privilege escalation -> data acquisition |
| Phishing callback | Local privilege escalation -> credentials -> lateral movement |
| Physical network access | Internal scanning -> same as above |
