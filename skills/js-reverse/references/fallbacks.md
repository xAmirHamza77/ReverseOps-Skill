# Fallback Strategy

When the current path makes no progress, fall back in this order:

1. Fall back from breakpoints to request observation
2. Fall back from source-code guessing to runtime evidence
3. Fall back from Node environment patching to page forensics
4. Fall back from deep deobfuscation to the minimal reproducible chain
